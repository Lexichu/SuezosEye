# SuezosEye
Effectively, it's MR3AV again except it supports modern PCSX2.

With Suezo's Eye, you can track:

- Monster stats
- Monster sense
- Money
- Monster Traits
- Monster age and lifespan
- Monster personality values
- Monster nutrition
- Monster moves
- Monster mash (...okay not really)

This is currently built targetting .net 9.0, so please use that.

Suezo's Eye will crash if you point it at PCSX2 1.6.0 if you're using 1.7 or later. Don't do that.

Look I forgot how to write a decent readme in the last few years okay.
